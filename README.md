# ENGI1020_ShowCase
This repository contains a collection of my assignments and lab solutions developed for the ENGI 1020 class. 

## Assignments
In the assignments section of this course, we focused on key programming concepts in Python. These include:

- **If-Else Statements**: Understanding conditional logic and its applications in programming.
- **Functions**: Learning about defining and calling functions, understanding the scope of variables within functions.
- **Global and Local Variables**: Gaining insight into variable scopes and their impact on program behavior.
- **Loops**: Mastering the use of both `for` and `while` loops for repetitive tasks and automating processes.

These assignments helped in build a strong foundation in Python programming, essential for tackling more complex problems in the labs.

## Labs
The labs in this course were centred around practical applications of programming with an Arduino. These hands-on sessions provided an opportunity to apply the programming concepts learned in the assignments to real-world scenarios. The use of Arduino in the labs enabled us to:

- Explore the interaction between software and hardware.
- Understand the principles of microcontroller programming.
- Implement projects that involved sensors, actuators, and other electronic components.
- Develop skills in problem-solving and debugging in a hardware environment.

Through these labs, we were able to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, gaining invaluable insights into the world of embedded systems and electronics.
